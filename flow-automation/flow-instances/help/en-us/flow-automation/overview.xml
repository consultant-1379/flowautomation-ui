                        <p>
                            Provides an execution environment for predefined flows.

            <p>The flows can enable the ability to go back in the setup phase user tasks. The flow automation
                application takes care of retaining the previously submitted data for all the widgets in a user task
                except for Scoping Panel and in that case the user is required to provide the data
                again.
